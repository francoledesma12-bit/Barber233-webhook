# 💈 Barber 233: AI-Powered Loyalty & Appointment Platform

## Project Overview and Key Achievements
This project is a high-impact, full-stack digital ecosystem designed to centralize business management, integrate appointment automation, and include a customer loyalty system. The core focus was achieving staff efficiency and brand growth.

**Measurable Business Results (High-Value Metrics):**
* **40% Efficiency Gain:** Implemented a central AI assistant with full access to **Google Workspace APIs (Calendar, Sheets)**, optimizing staff appointment management time by 40%.
* **35% Customer Acquisition Increase:** Designed and implemented a proprietary **Gamification System ("Coins")** that incentivized referrals, resulting in a 35% increase in new client acquisition.

## Architecture and Solution Flow
The system handles client requests via multiple channels (WhatsApp, etc.), uses the AI to instantly check availability against **Google Calendar** (the single source of truth for the business), and confirms the reservation. All transaction and loyalty data is then logged into **Google Sheets**.

## Technology Stack
* **Full Stack Development:** Built using React.js for the interface and Node.js for the backend services.
* **Backend Runtime:** Node.js / Express.js (or Firebase Functions for serverless structure).
* **Database:** Firebase Firestore (for high-speed data access).
* **Core Integrations:** Google Calendar API (Appointment Management), Google Sheets API (Data Logging/Gamification), Meta APIs (WhatsApp/Messenger), and **Gemini/LLM Integration** (Custom Conversation Logic).
